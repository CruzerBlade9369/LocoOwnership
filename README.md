# Loco Ownership

Own more locomotives than the museum allows you to and customize them like your demonstrators!

Not to be confused with [Rolling Stock Ownership](https://github.com/fauxnik/dv-rolling-stock-ownership), Loco Ownership is a separate mod and ***compatibility with each other are not tested***. Loco Ownership was partially inspired by RSO, and partially by the vanilla loco ownership feature.

- Purchase and own locomotives, separate from demonstrators.
- No license required, but you will need to have the license to the locomotive you want to own.
- Owned locomotives can only be serviced manually.
- Owned locomotives are paintable with any available paint.
- Owned locomotives don't despawn and won't contribute to your fee count.
- Sell locomotives when you don't want them anymore.

Locomotive prices are based on their license price, with purchase set at twice the license price and sell set at half license price. DE2 specifically has an artificial license price of $10000 as its actual license price is $0.

Some conditions you have to fulfill to be able to purchase a locomotive:
- Sufficient funds (duh).
- Fully restore the demonstrator of the locomotive type (minus paint, paint is hella expensive).
- Own the license of the locomotive you want to purchase.
- Own the manual service license.
- Fees must be cleared for the specific locomotive.
- Locomotive has to be naturally spawned (not spawned from comms radio).
- Not own more than 16 locomotives at a time (limit customizable).

Known issues:
- Locomotives may still despawn during the "game has been updated" event.
- (**MAJOR**) In rare cases, an owned locomotive might remove and replace the demonstrator loco of the same type. This issue is currently being investigated.

Some known incompatibilities with other mods:
- [Rolling Stock Ownership](https://github.com/fauxnik/dv-rolling-stock-ownership) (conflicting features)
