# Loco Ownership

Purchase locomotives from the railway and make sure they never get rotated or despawned, and you won't have to pay taxes for them again!

Not to be confused with [Rolling Stock Ownership](https://github.com/fauxnik/dv-rolling-stock-ownership), Loco Ownership is a separate mod and ***compatibility with each other are not tested***. Loco Ownership was partially inspired by RSO, and partially by the upcoming vanilla [vehicle ownership](http://www.derailvalley.com/future/#:~:text=Gameplay-,Vehicle%20ownership,-Buying%20and%20installing) feature. Take this mod as a stand-in for vanilla vehicle ownership until when it comes out.

- Purchase and own locomotives.
- No license required, but you will need to have the license to the locomotive you want to own.
- Owned locomotives can only be serviced manually.
- Owned locomotives don't despawn and won't contribute to your fee count.
- Sell locomotives when you don't want them anymore.

Locomotive prices are based on their license price, with purchase set at twice the license price and sell set at half license price. DE2 specifically has an artificial license price of $10000 as its actual license price is $0.

Some conditions you have to fulfill to be able to purchase a locomotive:
- Sufficient funds (duh).
- Must have the license of the locomotive you want to purchase.
- Must have manual service license.
- Fees must be cleared for the specific locomotive.
- Locomotive has to be naturally spawned (not spawned from comms radio).
- Not own more than 16 locomotives at a time.

Some known incompatibilities with other mods:
- [Rolling Stock Ownership](https://github.com/fauxnik/dv-rolling-stock-ownership) (conflicting features)
- [Leasable Locos](https://github.com/wwwDayDream/LeasableLocos) (conflicting features)
