# LocoOwnership

Purchase locomotives from the railway and make sure they never get rotated or despawned, and you won't have to pay taxes for them again!

Not to be confused with [Rolling Stock Ownership](https://github.com/fauxnik/dv-rolling-stock-ownership), Loco Ownership is a separate mod and ***compatibility with each other are not tested***. Loco Ownership was partially inspired by RSO, and partially by the upcoming vanilla [vehicle ownership](http://www.derailvalley.com/future/#:~:text=Gameplay-,Vehicle%20ownership,-Buying%20and%20installing) feature. Take this mod as a stand-in for vanilla vehicle ownership until when it comes out.

- Purchase and own locomotives.
- No license required, but you will need to have the license to the locomotive you want to own.
- Owned locomotives can only be serviced manually.
- Owned locomotives don't despawn and won't contribute to your fee count.
- Sell locomotives when you don't want them anymore.
