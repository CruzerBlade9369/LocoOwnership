# Loco Ownership

Own more locomotives than the museum allows you to and customize them like your demonstrators!

Not to be confused with [Rolling Stock Ownership](https://github.com/fauxnik/dv-rolling-stock-ownership), Loco Ownership is a separate mod and ***compatibility with each other are not tested***. Loco Ownership was partially inspired by RSO, and partially by the vanilla loco ownership feature.

- Purchase and own locomotives, separate from demonstrators.
- No license required, but you will need to have the license to the locomotive you want to own.
- Owned locomotives can only be serviced manually.
- Owned locomotives are paintable with any available paint.
- Owned locomotives don't despawn and won't contribute to your fee count.
- Sell locomotives when you don't want them anymore.

Read the [wiki](https://github.com/CruzerBlade9369/LocoOwnership/wiki) for more information.

Known issues:
- Locomotives may still despawn during the "game has been updated" event.

Some known incompatibilities with other mods:
- [Rolling Stock Ownership](https://github.com/fauxnik/dv-rolling-stock-ownership) (conflicting features)
